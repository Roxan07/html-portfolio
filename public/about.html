  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Hello, my name is Roshan Shah, and I was born and raised in Gangtok, Sikkim. I am currently in my third year of
    pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at VIT University. During my studies, I have explored various
    fields within the tech industry and developed a keen interest in web development.</p>
  <p>As a beginner in this field, I am committed to learning and creating small projects to hone my skills. This
    portfolio, crafted using HTML, is one such project. As I gain more knowledge, I plan to enhance and redesign it to
    better reflect my growing expertise.</p>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to sharing my journey with you.</p>
